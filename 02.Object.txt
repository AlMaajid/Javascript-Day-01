02.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

-> A JavaScript object is a collection of named values having state and behaviour(properties and method).

-> For Example: Person, Car, Pen, Bike, Personal Computer, Washing Machine etc

-> The Values are written as name:Value pairs(name and value separated by a colon).

-> For Example: var car = {
  brand: 'Mercedes',
  model: 'C-Class',
  color: 'White',
  fuel: 'Diesel',
  weight: '850Kg',
  mileage: '8Kmpl',
  rating: 4.5,
};

-> properties can usually be changed, added and deleted, but some are read only.

-> The syntax for adding a property to an object is : objectName.objectProperty = propertyValue;

-> The syntax for deleting a property from an object is : delete objectName.objectProperty;

-> The syntax to access a property from an object is: 
objectName.property; Example: car.model;
